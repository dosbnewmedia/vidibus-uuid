= vidibus-uuid

This gem is part of the open source SOA framework Vidibus: http://www.vidibus.org

It generates compact UUIDs. Basically, this is an abstraction of http://github.com/assaf/uuid


== Installation

Add the dependency to the Gemfile of your application:
gem "vidibus-uuid"

Then call bundle install on your console.


== Basic Usage

  Vidibus::Uuid.generate
  # => "b063263064e0012d47b658b035f038ab"


== Usage in Mongoid model

  class MyModel
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Vidibus::Uuid::Mongoid
  end

This will extend your model as follows:

  class MyModel
    include Mongoid::Document
  
    field :uuid
    index :uuid, :unique => true
  
    before_validation :generate_uuid
    validates :uuid, :uniqueness => true, :uuid => true
  
    private
  
    def generate_uuid
      return unless new_record?
      self.uuid ||= Vidibus::Uuid.generate
    end
  end


== Validation of custom attributes

To verfify that custom attributes are formatted as UUID, add the uuid validator to your model:

  class MyModel
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :product_uuid
    validates :product_uuid, :uuid => { :allow_blank => true }
  end
